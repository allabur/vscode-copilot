## General Instructions (applies to all files)

```
glob: **/*
```
- All code, comments, and documentation must be in English.
- Follow SOLID principles, PEP 8, and use reStructuredText (reST) docstrings for all public functions/classes.
- Use step-wise comments ("Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc.) except for default kwargs extraction.
- Write clear, descriptive names and optimize for readability and performance.
- All code must be tested and follow the Conventional Commits format for commit messages.
- Reference AGENTS.md and CONTRIBUTING.md for full guidelines.
- Use requirements.txt or pyproject.toml with pinned versions for reproducibility.
- Use a modular, layered architecture with a src/ folder for main code and notebooks/ for Jupyter work.
- All public code must be documented and tested.
- Use only well-maintained, widely adopted packages.
- All contributions must follow the Conventional Commits specification.

## Markdown Documentation Instructions (applies to .md files)

```
glob: **/*.md
```
- All documentation must be in English and clear for an international research/engineering audience.
- Use descriptive titles and section headers (use `#`, `##`, `###` appropriately).
- Always include a table of contents for files longer than 30 lines.
- Use bullet points, numbered lists, and code blocks for clarity.
- Document all public modules, scripts, and workflows with:
  - Purpose and context
  - Usage examples (with code blocks)
  - Inputs/outputs if relevant
- Reference coding standards and contribution guidelines where appropriate (link to AGENTS.md and CONTRIBUTING.md).
- For technical documentation, prefer reStructuredText (reST) docstrings in code, but use Markdown for user-facing docs.
- Use step-wise explanations for complex procedures ("Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc.).
- All `.md` files must be reviewed for clarity, completeness, and adherence to project standards before merging.
- Use consistent formatting and avoid excessive length in any single section.
- For changelogs, use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.
- For commit/contribution docs, reference the Conventional Commits specification.

## Example: Task-Specific Instructions

```
glob: docs/**/*.md
```
- For all documentation in the `docs/` folder, ensure:
  - Each file starts with a summary of its purpose.
  - Technical notes reference related modules or scripts in `src/`.
  - Research notes include references to relevant literature or datasets if applicable.

For more details, see AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and the Markdown files in the `docs/` folder.
